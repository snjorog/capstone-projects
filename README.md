# Student Performance Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes student performance data to understand the factors influencing academic outcomes. The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, includes variables such as hours studied, previous scores, extracurricular activities, sleep hours, sample question papers practiced, and the performance index. The analysis aims to provide actionable insights for improving student performance through data-driven recommendations.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following variables:

-   **Hours Studied:** Number of hours a student studied.
-   **Previous Scores:** Previous academic performance (e.g., test scores).
-   **Extracurricular Activities:** Whether the student participates in extracurricular activities (Yes/No).
-   **Sleep Hours:** Number of hours of sleep per night.
-   **Sample Question Papers Practiced:** Number of sample question papers the student practiced.
-   **Performance Index:** The outcome or dependent variable measuring student performance.

## Business Questions Addressed

1.  **Performance Analysis:**
    -   What is the correlation between the number of hours studied and the performance index?
    -   How much do previous scores predict current performance?
    -   Do students who practice more sample question papers tend to perform better?
2.  **Behavior and Lifestyle:**
    -   How does sleep quality (hours of sleep) affect student performance?
    -   Do students who engage in extracurricular activities perform better or worse than those who don't?
    -   Is there an optimal balance between sleep, study time, and extracurricular participation?
3.  **Interventions and Recommendations:**
    -   What combination of study hours, sleep, and extracurricular activities maximizes student performance?
    -   Are students with poor previous scores improving with more study time or other interventions?
4.  **Segmentation and Grouping:**
    -   Can students be grouped based on similar study habits and performance outcomes?
    -   Are there patterns among high-performing versus low-performing students?
5.  **Predictive Modeling:**
    -   Can student performance be predicted accurately based on these factors?
    -   What is the most influential factor in predicting student success?
