ACT Score Analysis Project
1. Project Objectives:
Define goals of the ACT analysis.
Identify trends in overall ACT scores.
Analyze ACT score performance across various demographic subgroups.
Quantify achievement gaps between subgroups.
Provide insights to stakeholders to inform strategies for educational improvement.
2. Data Collection and Preparation:
Determine where the ACT data is sourced from (e.g., official ACT reports, state/school records).
Data is sourced from ACT
Collect relevant ACT data, ensuring you have comprehensive information for analysis.
The following data points were collected:
ACT Composite Score
ACT English Score
ACT Mathematics Score
ACT Reading Score
ACT Science Score
Gender
Ethnicity
Socioeconomic Status (e.g., Free/Reduced Lunch eligibility)
High School Graduation Year
Cleanse the data of any inconsistencies or errors.
Data cleaning steps included:
Handling missing values (e.g., imputation, removal).
Identifying and addressing outliers.
Correcting data entry errors.
Standardizing data formats.
Ensure the data is in a format suitable for analysis.
Data was structured in a tabular format (CSV) for analysis with Python (Pandas library).
3. Data Exploration:
Descriptive Statistics: Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for ACT scores and relevant variables.
Descriptive statistics were calculated for the following:
Overall ACT Composite Score: [Mean = X, Median = Y, Standard Deviation = Z]
ACT English Score: [Mean = X, Median = Y, Standard Deviation = Z]
ACT Mathematics Score: [Mean = X, Median = Y, Standard Deviation = Z]
ACT Reading Score: [Mean = X, Median = Y, Standard Deviation = Z]
ACT Science Score: [Mean = X, Median = Y, Standard Deviation = Z]
Breakdowns by Gender (Male/Female): [Provide means and standard deviations for each]
Breakdowns by Ethnicity (if available): [Provide means and standard deviations for each]
Socioeconomic Status: [Provide means and standard deviations, e.g., for Free/Reduced Lunch vs. Not Eligible]
Create visualizations (histograms, box plots, cumulative distribution, bar, pie plots) to understand the distribution of ACT scores.
Visualizations created:
Histograms of ACT Composite Scores, English, Math, Reading, and Science scores.
Box plots comparing ACT Composite Scores across gender and ethnicity.
Cumulative distribution plots of ACT Composite Scores for different subgroups.
Bar charts showing the average ACT scores by high school graduation year.
Pie charts illustrating the percentage distribution of test-takers by ethnicity and gender.
4. Performance Analysis:
Score Trends: Analyze historical trends in overall ACT scores to identify patterns or changes over time.
Trend analysis:
Average ACT scores [increased/decreased/remained stable] from [Year] to [Year].
The most significant change occurred between [Year] and [Year], with an average score change of [X points].
[Describe any observed trends, e.g., increasing scores in math, declining scores in English, etc.]
Subgroup Analysis: Break down scores by demographic subgroups (e.g., gender, ethnicity) to identify variations.
Subgroup comparisons:
Gender: [Males/Females] scored an average of [X] points higher on the ACT Composite than [Females/Males].
Ethnicity:
[Ethnic Group 1] scored an average of [X] on the ACT Composite.
[Ethnic Group 2] scored an average of [Y] on the ACT Composite.
[Provide similar comparisons for all reported ethnic groups]
Achievement Gap Analysis: Identify disparities in ACT scores among student subgroups.
Achievement gaps:
The achievement gap between [Ethnic Group 1] and [Ethnic Group 2] on the ACT Composite is [Z] points.
Students eligible for free/reduced lunch scored an average of [A] points lower than their non-eligible peers.
5. Share Findings:
Communicate the results with relevant stakeholders, educators, administrators, and policymakers.
Findings will be shared through:
A written report summarizing the key findings and providing recommendations.
A presentation to [Stakeholder Group(s)].
Interactive data visualizations accessible online.
[Specify any other communication methods]
